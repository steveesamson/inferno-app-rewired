# inferno-app-rewired

Tweak the create-inferno-app webpack config(s) without using 'eject' and without creating a fork of the inferno-scripts.

All the benefits of create-inferno-app without the limitations of "no config". You can add plugins, loaders whatever you need.

> All you have to do is create your app using create-inferno-app and then rewire it https://github.com/steveesamson/inferno-app-rewired.
